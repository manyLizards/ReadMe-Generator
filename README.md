# ReadMe-Generator

## Description
The motivation behind this project was to familiarize myself with node.js and its potential. I built it to challenge myself and prove to myself that I am capable. It generates an automatic ReadMe for projects so there's no added stress to each project. I learned a little about backend programming and how exactly node.js can be incporporated.
